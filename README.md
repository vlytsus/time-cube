# Time Cube
Finally I’ve made something useful from my Arduino. The Time Cube is a gadget to track your time. Flip it to Work->Learn->Shores->Rest and it will count the time you spend on that activity. I hope it will motivate me to “learn” more and collect statistic about my workday. I plan to add new features like notifications about rest, emails, and calendar appointments.

Client application is written in Java using JavaFX for UI part.
